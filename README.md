## Project: Zwischen

Not every student at Fgcu has access to a car, and those who do may not have the desire to constantly use their own gas.
Compiled with FGCUâ€™s focus on environmental care, students have every reason to carpool. Zwischen is a ride sharing app,
designed to help students at FGCU get around, as well as helping to reduce car emissions and forming friendships.

### Zwischen 2.0

This is a continuation of the original program [Zwischen](https://github.com/zgreening/Zwischen).

## Installation:

1. Download and run the jar file.

note: The lib folder must be in the same directory as the jar file.

### Dependencies

[derby.jar](https://db.apache.org/derby/)

The derby.jar file is part of the lib source files. You will need to set up the derby.jar file to run the program. To install, simply add the derby.jar file to project dependancies in the IDE. For [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), click File/Project Structure/Modules, click the +, click jars or directories, select derby.jar from the lib folder, and click ok. Derby.jar should now be installed and the program should be ready to run.

## Usage:

At first use, click the create account button, and fill in the text boxes with the appropriate information.
Once your account is created, log in, and either set your schedule by clicking the Driver Schedule button, 
or request a ride with the Request Ride button. Over time, friends can be added,
allowing for greater consistency of scheduling through the app.
